# ApartmentList Code Challenge - Family Friday

Submission by YEN TRAN

## Approach
I chose to write this program in JavaScript and Node.js since it's the language I am most familiar with and use at work. The core logic of shuffling, creating and validating the group count is mostly done in the groupProcessor.js file with the index file handleing all the interactions with the console. The tests were written to check this core functionality. Thanks for the opportunity to write this program. I had fun!

## Setup Instructions

1. Navigate to root directory and install node dependencies packages:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the program:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

  If you plan to load a file as an input parameter, please place the file in the 'data' directory.

3. Running tests

   ```sh
   npm test
   ```
